# Network Design and Implementation Project 
**Implemented by:** Hala Mohammed

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a structured network for a small-to-medium business environment. It covers subnetting, basic network configurations, and DHCP setup for specific network segments.

## Project Overview

The project consists of multiple network segments, including:

- Business Departments (e.g., IT, HR, CFO)
- Server Farm (Web, FTP, Database servers)
- Secretary/Administrative network

Each network segment has been carefully subnetted and configured with IP addresses, VLANs, and routing to ensure proper connectivity and segmentation.

## Parts of the Project

1. **Subnetting**  
   Detailed IP addressing and subnetting for different network segments based on host requirements.

2. **Basic Configurations**  
   Configuration of switches and routers including VLANs, interface IPs, and basic connectivity testing.

3. **DHCP Setup**  
   Dynamic IP assignment for the Secretary Network to simplify host configuration.

## Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer (or any network simulation software)
- IP Address Planning and Subnet Calculations

## Key Learnings

- Understanding and applying subnetting in real network scenarios.
- Configuring routers and switches for multiple network segments.
- Implementing DHCP for dynamic IP management.
- Documenting network setup for maintenance and scalability.
